# Mobile-Robot-based-on-Arduino

The goal of this work is the design and production of an obstacle avoidance and line follower remote-controlled robot, based on the Arduino UNO board which is connected to the sensors and actuators of the robot. After developing the program in Arduino IDE software, and embedding it in the ATmega 328p microcontroller which executes the instructions of the code that can ensure us the remote control of the robot via an Android device with the Bluetooth application in all directions by the connecting to the HC-05 bluetooth module. The L298N motor controller is responsible for controlling the two direct current motors. Our robot aims to follow the lines using the infrared sensor and it is also able to stop at obstacles using the HC-SR04 sensor.
